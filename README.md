# indata2json
Converter for VMEC inputs (INDATA namelist) to JSON.

Default values for the input parameters are set in `read_indata_namelist()`
in [`vmec_input.f`](https://github.com/ORNL-Fusion/LIBSTELL/blob/master/Sources/Modules/vmec_input.f).

Prior to reading the namelist, the `extcur` array is filled with a large constant (`cbig` in vparams).
If `extcur` entries are specified in the namelist, they overwrite the unreasonably large values in `extcur`,
which is checked for when determining the size of the `extcur` array to export to the JSON file.
This way, the `mgrid` file does not need to be read to determine the size of the `extcur` array.
In order to implement this logic, I needed to slightly adjust `vmec_input.f`.
The modified version is included in this repository at [`src/vmec_input.f`](src/vmec_input.f)

This behavior can be disabled by specifying `--truncate_extcur` as a separate command line argument.
Then, only the part of the `extcur` array from the first element to the last non-zero element is exported to JSON.
This is more similar to the original VMEC behavior,
but you must take care yourself to check if you specified all required coil currents.

A subfolder can be specified, which will be put in front of the `mgrid_file` variable.
Specify this on the command line as `--mgrid_folder some_subfolder` and,
for a `mgrid_file = 'mgrid_w7x.nc'` entry in the `INDATA` namelist,
the following will be printed to the JSON output:
`"mgrid_file":"some_subfolder/mgrid_w7x.nc"`.
Note that a slash (`/`) is hardcoded for now (sorry Windows users).

Furthermore, after reading the namelist, a few fixups are done there as well:
* If all entries in `niter_array` stayed at their default values of -1,
  they are all set to the value of `niter` (which defaults to 100).
* `raxis` --> `raxis_cc` and `zaxis` --> `zaxis_cs` for all non-zero entries in `raxis`,`zaxis`
* `lfreeb` is initialized to `true` in `read_indata_namelist()`, but re-set to `false` if `mgrid_file` remains at the default value `NONE`.
* `bloat` is set to 1 if it was set to `0`, which is invalid.
* if running in constrained-iota mode (`ncurr` .ne. 1), `bloat` is checked to equal 1
* `mpol` and `ntor` are set to their absolute values; negative counts of Fourier harmonics make no sense.
* the absolute value of `tcon0` is taken and it is coerced to a maximum value of 1
* The entries in `ns_array` are checked to be monotonically increasing
* if `nvacskip` was not set, it is initialized to `nfp`

For further details, refer to the actual code (linked below).

## Clone with submodules
This repository uses two Git submodules (`LIBSTELL` and `json-fortran`)
which need to be properly cloned for the build process to work.

Here is how you **get this repo including the submodules**:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/jonathanschilling/indata2json.git
```

and here is how you get the submodules if you accidentially cloned the repo without the submodules
using the command in the first line here:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jonathanschilling/indata2json.git
cd indata2json
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Building

This is a totally standard Makefile setup.
Just type

```bash
make
```

and you should be good to go.
The executable then is `indata2json` and it can be called as follows:

```bash
./indata2json demo_inputs/input.w7x_ref_167_12_12
```

which in turn creates a file `w7x_ref_167_12_12.json` in the current working directory.

### CMake

Alternatively, you can build the package via CMake:
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

The executable will be at the path `build/indata2json`.
